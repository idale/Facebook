Facebook
========
Time spent: Approx. 13 hours

Optional: None

1. Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
2. Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
3. On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
4. If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.


Notes:
Monday night's video was pretty helpful on breaking things down that related to this project.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around the different view controllers and when and where they appear. Hopefully, the next projects and class will drill it down more.
